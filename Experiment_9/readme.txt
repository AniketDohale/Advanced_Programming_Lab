# Aim:
- Write two python programs: Simple half-duplex and Full-Duplex Chat programs. In
half-duplex, a connection is made and the service starts, only one person can type. The
other participant must wait to get a message before being prompted to enter a message.
Once a message is sent, the sender must wait for a reply before being allowed to send
another message. One participant will be on the server side; the other will be on the
client side. In Full-Duplex, both parties can send and receive independent of each other.
