# Content:
-> Classes and OOP: classes, objects, attributes and methods, defining classes and creating objects
-> Other OOP concepts: inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading, abstract classes

# Aim:
- Write a python program to define a class, Point, that holds an (x, y) coordinate. The
class is in file Shape.py, and now add the following operations the class where p, q, r are
Point class and n is any number: 
    i) p = q + r, 
    ii) p += q , 
    iii) p = q - r, 
    iv) p -= q, 
    v) p = q * n,
    vi) p *= n, 
    vii) p = q / n , 
    viii) p /= n
